                Since 2012, Audemars Piguet Contemporary, the cultural arm of the luxury Swiss watchmaker, has been commissioning site-specific works from artists such as Ryoji Ikeda at London’s 180 The Strand and Meriem Bennani on New York’s High Line. Now, for the occasion of its 10th anniversary and the inaugural Paris+ par Art Basel (October 20–23), the program has tapped Andreas Angelidakis for its first project in the French capital.

                Although his training is in architecture, Angelidakis stopped designing physical structures in the early 2000s. Today, he describes himself as “an architect who doesn’t build,” and his art practice grapples with the idea of ruins via 3D virtual spaces.

                 Agra (/ˈɑːɡrə/, Hindustani: [ˈaːgraː] (About this soundlisten)) is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Agra district of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is 206 kilometres (128 mi) south of the national capital New Delhi. Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and 24th in India.

Sikandar Lodi was the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1504, and so he is regarded as being the founder of Agra. Sikandar Lodi's son, Ibrahim Lodi, was defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526 by Babur, which marked the beginning of Mughal Empire. In a brief interruption in Mughal rule between 1540 and 1556, Sher Shah Suri, established the short lived Sur Empire. Agra was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1648, under the Mughal Emperors Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan, after which Shah Jahan shifted the capital to Delhi. The Mughal Empire saw the building of many monuments, especially Taj Mahal. The city was later taken by the Jats and then Marathas and later still fell to the British Raj.

            <h2>Phuket (/ˌpuːˈkɛt/; Thai: ภูเก็ต, [pʰūː.kèt], is one of the southern provinces of Thailand. It consists of the island of Phuket, the country's largest island, and another 32 smaller islands off its coast. It lies off the west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea. Phuket Island is connected by the Sarasin Bridge to Phang Nga Province to the north. The next nearest province is Krabi, to the east across Phang Nga Bay.

                Thailand's largest isle lingers on the country's southwest coast, kissed by the Listerine-green Andaman Sea. The interior is a lush jungly tangle, its 36 beaches a paint chart of creams and golds, and there's a capital city – Phuket Town – packed with character and cracking good street food.
                
                That's not to say it's perfect: large chunks of the island have been horribly overdeveloped, but those areas (such as Patong) are largely confined to the southwest coast and are easily avoided – leaving those in the know to lap up the rest of the island's many charms. </h2>

              <h2>Ranthambore National Park is located about 13.5 kilometers from the city of Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan. Located at the junction of the Aravali and Vindhya hill ranges, this is one of the finest places to view wild animals, especially as they are used to being stared at here. The park covers an area of approximately 400 sq km, and if combined with the area of Sawai Man Singh Sanctuary area, is around 500 sq km. <br>

                <br>Ranthambore National Park is dotted with structures that remind you of bygone eras. There are numerous water bodies scattered all across the park, which provide perfect relief to the wild animals during the scorching hot days in summers. A huge fort, after which the park is named, towers over the park atop a hill. There are many ruins of bygone eras scattered all over the jungle, which give it a unique, wonderful and mixed flavour of nature, history and wildlife. Tigers at Ranthambore National park have been known to even hunt in full view of human visitors.<br></h2>

            <h1>2020, Mauritius S.Africa.</h1>

            <h2>Mauritius (/məˈrɪʃ(i)əs, mɔːˈ-/ (About this soundlisten) mə-RISH-(ee-)əs, maw-; French: Maurice [mɔʁis, moʁis] (About this soundlisten); Morisyen: Moris [moʁis]), officially the Republic of Mauritius, is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) off the southeast coast of the African continent, east of Madagascar. It includes the eponymous main island of Mauritius and Rodrigues, Agaléga and St. Brandon.[9][10] The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues form part of the Mascarene Islands, along with nearby Réunion, a French overseas department. The capital and largest city, Port Louis, is located on Mauritius, where most of the population is concentrated. The country spans 2,040 square kilometres (790 sq mi) and has an Exclusive Economic Zone covering 2.3 million square kilometres. <br>
            <br>Arab sailors were possibly the first to discover the uninhabited island around 975, which they called Dina Arobi. The earliest confirmed discovery was in 1507 by Portuguese sailors, who otherwise took little interest in the islands. The Dutch took possession in 1598, establishing a succession of short-lived settlements before abandoning their efforts in 1710. France took control in 1715, renaming it Isle de France. In 1810 the island was seized by Great Britain, and four years later France ceded Mauritius and its dependencies to Britain. As a British colony, Mauritius included Rodrigues, Agalega, St. Brandon, Tromelin, the Chagos Archipelago, and, until 1906, the Seychelles.[9][12] Sovereignty over Tromelin is disputed between Mauritius and France, as it was not specifically mentioned in the Treaty of Paris.[13] Mauritius remained a primarily plantation-based colony of the United Kingdom until independence in 1968. </h2>
